      <h3><span>1</span>Create</h3>
      <p>his would consist of a function which we would call when a new library book
        is being added to the catalog. The program calling the function would supply
        the values for “title”, “author”, and “isbn”. After this function is called,
        there should be a new entry in the books resource corresponding to this new
        book. Additionally, the new entry is assigned a unique id, which can be used
        to access this resource later.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-explain">
      <h3><span>2</span>Read</h3>
      <p>This would consist of a function which would be called to see all of the books
        currently in the catalog. This function call would not alter the books in the
        catalog - it would simply retrieve the resource and display the results. We would
        also have a function to retrieve a single book, for which we could supply the title,
        author, or ISBN. Again, this book would not be modified, only retrieved.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="section-explain">
      <h3><span>3</span>Update</h3>
      <p>There should be a function to call when information about a book must be changed.
        The program calling the function would supply the new values for “title”, “author”,
        and “isbn”. After the function call, the corresponding entry in the books resource
        would contain the new fields supplied.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-explain">
      <h3><span>4</span>Delete</h3>
      <p>There should be a function to call to remove a library book from the catalog. The
        program calling the function would supply one or more values (“title”, “author”, and/or “isbn”)
        to identify the book, and then this book would be removed from the books resource. After this
        function is called, the books resource should contain all of the books it had before,
        except for the one just deleted.</p>
